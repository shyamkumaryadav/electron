# The config expects the following environment variables to be set:
#  - "GN_CONFIG" Build type. One of {'testing', 'release'}.
#  - "GN_EXTRA_ARGS" Additional gn arguments for a build config,
#      e.g. 'target_cpu="x86"' to build for a 32bit platform.
#      https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/reference.md#target_cpu
#      Don't forget to set up "NPM_CONFIG_ARCH" and "TARGET_ARCH" accordingly
#      if you pass a custom value for 'target_cpu'.
#  - "ELECTRON_RELEASE" Set it to '1' upload binaries on success.
#  - "NPM_CONFIG_ARCH" E.g. 'x86'. Is used to build native Node.js modules.
#      Must match 'target_cpu' passed to "GN_EXTRA_ARGS" and "TARGET_ARCH" value.
#  - "TARGET_ARCH" Choose from {'ia32', 'x64', 'arm', 'arm64', 'mips64el'}.
#      Is used in some publishing scripts, but does NOT affect the Electron binary.
#      Must match 'target_cpu' passed to "GN_EXTRA_ARGS" and "NPM_CONFIG_ARCH" value.
#  - "UPLOAD_TO_STORAGE" Set it to '1' upload a release to the Azure bucket.
#      Otherwise the release will be uploaded to the GitHub Releases.
#      (The value is only checked if "ELECTRON_RELEASE" is defined.)
#
# The publishing scripts expect access tokens to be defined as env vars,
# but those are not covered here.
